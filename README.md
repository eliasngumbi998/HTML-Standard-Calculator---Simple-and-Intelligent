# HTML-Standard-Calculator---Simple-and-Intelligent
I am sharing to you this simple, standard and intelligent Calculator that is pure developed using HTML + CSS  The calculators saves calculation history in the history box and would be available to user even after restarting browser and system in general. I saves the history not in any database or file, but rather in the browser's storage internally.  It also accept numbers like 1-9, enter key, and dot (.) sign. It don't accept two dots at the same calculation (e.g. 30.19.3).  You can simply integrate this feature to your website. Feel free to contact me @ eliasngumbi54@gmail.com
